Note if using windows, please checkout the window path bug brunch, as there is an issue building jsx sub components with paths on windows with gulp.

Install:

1. npm i
2. gulp
3. Run nodemon ./server/server.js  ( or nodemon  .\server\server.js on windows )

Note this app uses  libfontconfig1 ( to run reports) install if needed by:
1. yum install phantomjs: 
2. yum install freetype
3 .yum install fontconfig

- If you get an error saying libfontconfig1 is not found the above steps have not worked

- When a report is made it is also saved in the "dist" folder.

- This code runs on port 3000, change that if need be in server/server file


Contact nick@technocrusaders.com, if you have any questions.

Good Luck!
