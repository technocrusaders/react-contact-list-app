!!!!! DONT USE THIS, this was my very first and old unclean code !!!!!!!!
however it worked last time I loaded it up, i'll be uploading
a new sample react app soon...


A ReactJS Conact List Demo made by  Nick Gray 20016
website: technocrusaders.com
 
Install:

1. npm i
2. gulp
3. Run nodemon ./server/server.js  ( or nodemon  .\server\server.js on windows )

Note this app uses  libfontconfig1 ( to run reports) install if needed by:
1. yum install phantomjs: 
2. yum install freetype
3 .yum install fontconfig

- If you get an error saying libfontconfig1 is not found the above steps have not worked

- When a report is made it is also saved in the "dist" folder.

- This code runs on port 3000, change that if need be in server/server file


Conact nick@technocrusaders.com, if you have any questions.

Good Luck!
